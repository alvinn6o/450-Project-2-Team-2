# Our goal with this visualization is to answer more in depth questions about flight delays from the year 2020. The kinds of questions we 
# would want to answer are which airline has the most delays in a specific month by which type of delay. The previous visualization using 
# this data could show which airline had the most delays, but would not be able to get into specific details.
